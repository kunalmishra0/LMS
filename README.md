LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

A **C-based Library Management System** should provide features that cover basic library operations. The system should allow for managing books, users (borrowers), and transactions. Here are the essential features it should include:

### 1. **Book Management**

- **Add Book**: Add new books with details like title, author, publication year, genre, and ISBN number.
- **Delete Book**: Remove books from the system.
- **Search Books**:
  - By title, author, ISBN, or genre.
- **View All Books**: Display a list of all available books.
- **Update Book Details**: Modify information such as title, author, or availability.

### 2. **User Management (Borrower/Member)**

- **Add User**: Register new members with details like name, user ID, contact information, and membership type (e.g., student, teacher).
- **Delete User**: Remove members from the system.
- **Search Users**: Search for users by name or user ID.
- **View All Users**: Display a list of all registered users.
- **Update User Information**: Modify user details like address, phone number, or membership status.

### 3. **Borrowing and Returning System**

- **Issue Book**: Allow users to borrow books.
  - Track who borrowed which book, along with the due date.
- **Return Book**: Record the return of borrowed books.
  - Calculate any fines for late returns (if applicable).
- **Renew Book**: Extend the borrowing period for a book.

### 4. **Inventory Management**

- **Check Availability**: Check if a particular book is available or has been issued to someone.
- **Track Book Quantity**: Maintain information on the total number of copies of each book and how many are available.
- **Notify on Low Stock**: Alert if a book's available copies are running low.

### 5. **Fines and Fees**

- **Calculate Late Fines**: Automatically calculate late return fines based on the number of overdue days.
- **Fine Payment**: Allow users to pay fines (could just be a record update).

### 6. **Reports and Statistics**

- **Book Borrowing Report**: Track which books are most frequently borrowed.
- **User Borrowing History**: Generate reports of a specific user's borrowing history.
- **Overdue Book Report**: List all overdue books and corresponding users.
- **Books Inventory Report**: Show all books in the system with details of how many are available/issued.

### 7. **Admin and Security Features**

- **Admin Login**: Require an administrator to log in to access management features like adding/deleting books and users.
- **User Login**: Allow users to log in to check their borrowing history or check book availability.
- **Password Management**: Allow users to change/reset their password.

### 8. **Additional Features**

- **Reservation System**: Allow users to reserve a book if itâ€™s currently unavailable.
- **Notifications**: Notify users of book due dates or overdue fines.
- **Backup and Restore**: Backup the library data and restore it when needed.
- **Search History**: Keep track of search queries for analyzing user behavior.

### 9. **File Handling and Data Storage**

- **Data Storage**: Store book, user, and transaction data using files (e.g., text files or binary files).
- **Efficient Searching and Sorting**: Implement algorithms for fast searching (like binary search for ISBN) and sorting (for organizing books by title, etc.).

### Possible Advanced Features (Optional)

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Though it's typically console-based in C, you could add a basic GUI using libraries like GTK+ for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Implement barcode scanning for easier book issue/return.
- **Multiple Branch Management**: Manage multiple branches of a library with the same system.

Each of these features can be implemented incrementally to build a robust library management system.
